# PDF Admin Delete Functionality Implementation

## Overview
Added admin-only PDF deletion functionality to the PDF Store Screen. This feature allows authenticated admins to delete PDFs from the library with proper confirmation dialogs and visual feedback.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Admin Authentication Check
- Added `_isAdmin` state variable to track admin status
- Integrated with existing `AuthService.isAdmin()` method
- Admin status is checked on screen initialization

### 2. Visual Admin Indicators
- Added "Admin" badge in the header when user is admin
- Changed subtitle text to "Manage and organize your documents" for admins
- Admin badge has a subtle glass effect with admin icon

### 3. Delete Functionality
- **Delete Buttons**: Added red delete buttons to all PDF card variants
  - `ModernPdfListCard`: Delete button positioned next to download button
  - `ModernPdfCard`: Delete button in header alongside download button  
  - `PdfCard`: Delete button in top action row
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Beautiful confirmation dialog with:
  - Warning icon and title
  - PDF title display
  - Warning text about irreversible action
  - Cancel and Delete buttons with proper styling
- **Error Handling**: Toast notifications for success/failure
- **Backend Integration**: Uses existing `PdfProvider.deletePdf()` method

### 4. Security
- Delete buttons only visible to admin users
- Backend already has `PdfService.deletePdf()` implementation
- Includes storage file deletion and database record removal

## Database Security (Optional)
Created `add_pdf_admin_policies.sql` file to restrict PDF deletion to admins only at the database level:
- Replaces public delete policy with admin-only policy
- Uses `is_admin(auth.uid())` function for authorization
- Optional update restrictions available

## Components Modified

### Main Screen
- `PdfStoreScreen`: Added admin status tracking and delete handlers

### PDF Cards
- `ModernPdfListCard`: Added `isAdmin` and `onDelete` parameters
- `ModernPdfCard`: Added `isAdmin` and `onDelete` parameters  
- `PdfCard`: Added `isAdmin` and `onDelete` parameters

### User Experience
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Consistent Material Design styling
- Proper loading states and error handling
- Visual feedback for all actions

## Usage
1. Admin users will see:
   - "Admin" badge in the header
   - Red delete buttons on all PDF cards
   - Delete confirmation dialogs
   - Success/error toast notifications

2. Regular users see no changes to existing functionality

## Backend Requirements
- Ensure admin authentication is properly configured
- Optionally run `add_pdf_admin_policies.sql` for database-level security
- Admin users must be properly configured in the `admin_users` table

## Files Modified
- `lib/screens/pdf_store_screen.dart` - Main implementation
- `add_pdf_admin_policies.sql` - Database security policies (new file)

The implementation maintains backward compatibility while adding powerful admin functionality with a clean, intuitive interface.
