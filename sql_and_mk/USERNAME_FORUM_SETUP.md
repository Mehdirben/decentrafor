# Username-Based Forum Setup Guide

## Overview

The forum has been modified to work without user authentication. Instead, users simply choose a unique username when they first access the forum, and this username is stored locally and used for all their forum activities.

## Key Changes Made

### üîÑ **Authentication Removed**
- No sign-in/sign-up required
- Users just pick a unique username
- Username is stored locally using SharedPreferences
- Username is registered in the `forum_users` table

### üÜî **Username System**
- **Username Setup Screen**: Shows when user first opens the app
- **Username Validation**: 3-20 characters, letters/numbers/underscores only
- **Availability Check**: Real-time check if username is taken
- **Local Storage**: Username persists across app restarts

### üóÑÔ∏è **Database Changes**
- **New Table**: `forum_users` (id, username, display_name, created_at, updated_at)
- **Updated Relations**: All foreign keys now point to `forum_users` instead of `auth.users`
- **Open RLS Policies**: Anyone can read/write (no authentication needed)
- **Sample Data**: Pre-populated with test users and topics

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
Run the new schema file in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Execute the content of forum_schema_username.sql
```

This will:
- Create the `forum_users` table
- Update all forum tables to use `forum_users` instead of `auth.users`
- Set up open RLS policies (no authentication required)
- Add sample categories, users, and topics for testing

### 2. Install Dependencies
The app now uses `shared_preferences` for local storage:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Run the Application
```bash
flutter run
```

## User Flow

### Returning Users

## Technical Details

- Manages local storage of username
- Checks username availability in real-time

### Username Provider (`lib/providers/username_provider.dart`)
- State management for username system
- Initializes username on app start
- Provides username availability checking

### Updated Forum Service

- Uses `forum_users` table instead of `auth.users`
- Maintains same functionality without authentication

### AppWrapper System

- Shows username setup screen if needed
- Transitions to main app once username is set

## Database Schema

### forum_users
```sql
id UUID PRIMARY KEY
username VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL  -- Lowercase, unique identifier
display_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL     -- What shows in the UI
created_at TIMESTAMP
updated_at TIMESTAMP
```

### Relationships
- `forum_topics.author_id` ‚Üí `forum_users.id`
- `forum_posts.author_id` ‚Üí `forum_users.id`  
- `forum_post_likes.user_id` ‚Üí `forum_users.id`

## Sample Data Included

### Categories
- Mathematics, Science, Literature, History
- Technology, Art & Design, Language Learning, General Discussion

### Test Users
- admin (Administrator)
- teacher_smith (Professor Smith)
- student_alice (Alice Cooper)
- mathwiz (Math Wizard)
- sciencefan (Science Enthusiast)

### Sample Topics
- "Welcome to Mathematics Discussion" in Mathematics category
- "Introduction to Scientific Method" in Science category

## Username Guidelines

### Validation Rules
- **Length**: 3-20 characters
- **Characters**: Letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_)
- **Uniqueness**: Must be unique across all users
- **Case**: Stored as lowercase, but display name preserves original case

### Reserved Usernames
Consider reserving certain usernames:
- admin, administrator, moderator, system
- root, null, undefined, anonymous

## Security Considerations

### Open Access
- No authentication means anyone can post
- Consider implementing basic moderation features
- Monitor for spam or inappropriate content

### Username Ownership
- Usernames are first-come, first-served
- No password protection on usernames
- Users can't "claim" usernames later

### Data Protection
- No personal information required
- Only username is stored
- Local storage only contains username

## Future Enhancements

1. **Moderation Tools**
   - Flag inappropriate content
   - Username blacklist
   - Content filtering

2. **Enhanced User System**
   - Optional user profiles
   - Avatar uploads
   - User reputation system

3. **Username Recovery**

   - Username history tracking

4. **Analytics**
   - Track popular topics
