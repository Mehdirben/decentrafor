# Thumbnail Deletion Fix

## Issue
When deleting a PDF, the thumbnail image was not being removed from Supabase storage, leaving orphaned files.

## Solution
Updated the `deletePdf` method in `PdfService` to also delete the associated thumbnail file.

## Changes Made

### `lib/services/pdf_service.dart`
- Modified `deletePdf` method to fetch both `file_url` and `thumbnail_url` from database
- Added thumbnail deletion logic that:
  - Extracts the thumbnail path from the URL
  - Deletes the thumbnail file from storage 
  - Includes error handling to continue deletion even if thumbnail removal fails
- Added error handling for both PDF and thumbnail deletion operations
- Used warning logs for storage deletion failures to avoid breaking the overall deletion process

## Technical Details

### Storage Structure
- PDFs stored in: `pdfs/[filename]`
- Thumbnails stored in: `thumbnails/[thumbnail_filename]`
- Both use the same bucket: `SupabaseConfig.pdfBucketName` (usually "pdfs")

### Error Handling
- If PDF file deletion fails: Logs warning and continues
- If thumbnail deletion fails: Logs warning and continues  
- If database deletion fails: Throws exception (critical failure)
- This ensures the database record is always cleaned up even if storage files can't be removed

### URL Format
Both PDF and thumbnail URLs follow the format:
```
https://[project-id].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/[bucket]/[path]
```

## Benefits
- ✅ No more orphaned thumbnail files
- ✅ Complete cleanup when deleting PDFs
- ✅ Robust error handling
- ✅ Storage space optimization
- ✅ Better resource management

## Testing
The fix has been implemented and should work immediately. When admins delete PDFs, both the PDF file and its thumbnail will be removed from storage.

## Files Modified
- `lib/services/pdf_service.dart` - Enhanced `deletePdf` method
